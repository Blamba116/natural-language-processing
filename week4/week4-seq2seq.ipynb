However, if you want to train your own machine translation system or intellectual chat bot, it would be useful to have access to compute resources like GPU, and be patient, because training of such systems is usually time consuming. \n",

    " - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) — an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence.\n",

The number of words might be huge, so it would be reasonable to filter them, for example, by frequency and leave only the frequent ones. Other strategies that your should consider are: data normalization (lowercasing, tokenization, how to consider punctuation marks), separate vocabulary for input and for output (e.g. for machine translation), some specifics of the task."
